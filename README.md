This is my repository for my C Data Structures class.
Learning to love pointers.
Basic stuff: stacks, queues, linked lists, and maybe trees later.
I'm using no typedefs for the regular struct declarations and such, as an exercise. I much prefer this way, the Linux Kernel style guide way xD
Feel free to suggest changes.
